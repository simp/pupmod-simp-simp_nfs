* Wed Jun 16 2021 Jeanne Greulich <jeanne.greulich@onyxpoint.com> - 1.0.2
- Fixed:
  - Bug where EL8 LDAP clients were unable to communicate with an EL7 LDAP
    server in `/etc/cron.hourly/create_home_directories.rb`, when the servers
    were in FIPS mode.
    - EL8 in FIPS mode could not talk to LDAP server on EL7 because the
      ciphers did not match.  The script was using the default policies,
      which only have TLS1_3 in them. EL7 uses an older version of openssl
      which does not have TLS1_3. Therefore, had to set the ciphers and CA 
      path in the script.      
- Added:
  - PKI parameters to `simp_nfs::create_home_directories`.
  - Management of PKI certificates in `simp_nfs::create_home_directories`.

* Wed Jan 13 2021 Chris Tessmer <chris.tessmer@onyxpoint.com> - 1.0.2
- Deprecated `simp_nfs::create_home_dirs::strip_128_bit_ciphers`.
  This option no longer affects any supported OSes.

* Fri Oct 16 2020 Liz Nemsick <lnemsick.simp@gmail.com> - 1.0.1
- Fixed:

    sample code in the README. Specifying the NFS server as a
    hostname is no longer supported due to limitations of firewalld.
  - Replaced deprecated 'classes' with 'simp:classes' in manifest
    documentation.
- Updated:
  - In the README, removed EL6 from the autofs known issue discussion
    and added more details on how to work around the problem.
