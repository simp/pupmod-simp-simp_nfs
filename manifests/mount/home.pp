# @summary Set up an ``NFS4`` client to point to mount your remote home directories
#
# If this system is also the NFS server, you need to set
# ``nfs::client::is_server`` to ``true`` or set
# ``simp_nfs::mount::home::nfs_server`` to ``127.0.0.1``.
#
# @param nfs_server
#   The NFS server to which you will be connecting
#
#   * If you are the server, please make sure that this is ``127.0.0.1``
#
# @param remote_path
#   The NFS share that you want to mount
#
# @param local_home
#   The local base for home directories
#
#   * Most sites will want this to be ``/home`` but some may opt for something
#     like ``/exports/home`` or the like.
#
#   * Top level directories will **not** be automatically managed
#
# @param port
#   The NFS port to which to connect
#
# @param sec
#   The sec mode for the mount
#
#   * Only valid with NFSv4
#
# @param options
#   The mount options string that should be used
#
#   * fstype and port will already be set for you
#
# @param at_boot
#   Ensure that this mount is mounted at boot time
#
#   * Has no effect if ``$use_autofs`` is set
#
# @param autodetect_remote
#   Use inbuilt autodetection to determine if the local system is the server
#   from which we should be mouting directories
#
#   * Generally, you should set this to ``false`` if you have issues with the
#     system mounting to ``127.0.0.1`` when your home directories are actually
#     on another system
#
# @param use_autofs
#   Enable automounting with Autofs
